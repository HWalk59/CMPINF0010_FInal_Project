A one sentence overview of your repository, meant for someone who is not familiar with the project:

This project aims to figure out the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh to be homeless in; it is intended as a guide for anyone who finds themselves recently homless and wishes to gather resources about the location with the most services avaliable to them as they get back on their feet.
